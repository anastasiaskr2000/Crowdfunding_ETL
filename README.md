# Crowdfunding_ETL

Project 2

In this ETL mini project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform data pertaining to various crowdfundng projects in order to determine which were successful & not, and uncover any potential trends.

We then created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema, uploading the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

See Resources for csv files & table schema.
