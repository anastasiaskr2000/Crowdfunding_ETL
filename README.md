# Crowdfunding_ETL

Project 2

In this ETL mini project we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform data. 

We then created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. 

Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
